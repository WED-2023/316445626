 Welcome to my website!

<h2>Q&A</h2>
<br/>   
<br/>
<h2>List of differences between web1, web2, and web3:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web1:</strong> Static web pages with basic HTML and limited user interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Web2:</strong> Dynamic web pages with advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for more user interaction and collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>Web3:</strong> A semantic web with highly structured data that allows for machine-readable content and more intelligent applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web1 was mainly used for displaying text and images. It was limited to static pages and had no interactive elements. Web2, on the other hand, allowed for dynamic web pages with more advanced features such as multimedia content, social media, and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Web3 takes things a step further by introducing semantic web technology. This makes it possible to create highly structured data that can be understood and used by machines. Web3 enables the creation of more intelligent applications that can automatically understand the meaning behind the content on the web and provide more personalized and targeted experiences for users.</p>
<p>Overall, the evolution of the web from web1 to web3 has been a journey from static, text-based pages to highly interactive, intelligent web applications that can understand and respond to user needs in a more sophisticated way.</p>

<h2>Query: "Best Italian restaurant in New York City"</h2>
<h3>Web 1.0:</h3>
<p>When searching for this query on Web 1.0, the user would likely get a list of search results that would include websites with basic information about Italian restaurants in New York City. The user would need to manually visit each website and read through the content to determine which restaurant might be the best.</p>
<h3>Web 2.0:</h3>
<p>When searching for this query on Web 2.0, the user would likely get a list of search results that would include websites such as Yelp, Google Maps, and Zagat, which provide reviews and ratings for restaurants. The user could filter their search results by rating or cuisine, and read through reviews from other users to determine which Italian restaurant might be the best.</p>
<h3>Web 3.0:</h3>
<p>When searching for this query on Web 3.0, the user would likely get a list of search results that include a combination of data from different sources. For example, the search engine might use data from restaurant review sites, social media, and location-based data to provide a more personalized and context-aware result. The user might also be able to use natural language processing to refine their search and get more accurate results, such as "Best Italian restaurant for a romantic dinner in Manhattan". Additionally, the search engine might use semantic web technologies to understand the user's intent and provide more relevant results based on their search history and preferences.</p>
